# Google Case Study: Bellabeat

## Scenario
Bellabeat is a high-tech company that manufactures health-focused smart products. Since it was founded in 2013, Bellabeat has grown quickly and is primarily positioned as a tech-driven wellness company for women. By 2016 the company created 5 primary products: the Bellabeat app, Leaf, Time, Spring, and Bellabeat membership. While Bellabeat is a successful company, analysis of consumer data would allow for more opportunities to grow. As part of the marketing analytics team we have been tasked with analyzing smart device data to gain insight into how customers are already using their smart devices. Using this information, the team can provide recommendations to guide marketing strategy for Bellabeat.
